##Technology
This application was created with Vanilla JS using the React library.
HTML and CSS was used for the design.

## Functionality
Your change calculator has four coins denominations. Enter in an amount
of change you would like and the calculator will calculate for you the
amount of each coin needed to return to you your exact change.

Users can click on change denominations to adjust currency values. If
the perfect change cannot be made, you will receive an error message.
Coin values can only be whole numbers.
